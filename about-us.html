          <h4>Designer, Copywriter</h4>
          <p>
            As wonderful as she is, Erica's spirit animal is duck. Trust,
            balance, warmth. The duck teaches you to transform the power of her
            heart and to use it for a higher ideal. Her plumage is
            water-repellent, and warming and that stands for the sliding of
            emotions from others so that they cannot touch her inside and she
            can find peace in herself.

          <p>

            Wolf power or spirit animals point to an appetite for freedom and
            living life powerfully, guided by instincts. When a wolf manifests
            its presence as a guide in your life, it could be a call to live
            your life more freely, to bring the intensity of passion in your
            everyday endeavors.

            Believe it or not, River used to be a very successful stockbroker in
            New York in the late 90s, early 00s, but suffered from the big crash
            in 2008. As she was standing in the middle of Wall Street she had a
            vision and saw a white light guiding her to Enlightenment. She knew
            in that moment she was destined to heal those suffering from mental,
            emotional and physical trauma. With this unique palm healing, River
            is able to transmit her gifted energies in those she’s working on
            healing even the deepest and darkest of traumas. She completed her
